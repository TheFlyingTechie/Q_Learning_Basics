# Q_Learning_Basics

This is the code for my tutorial on q learning on Instagram. It trains an AI to drive up a hill.
The required libraries for this program are:
1. Numpy
2. Gym
3. Tqdm

To have the output of the program saved to a file, replace "output = False" with "output = True".
If you only want the summary of the program, replace

    output = False
    summary = False
to
    
    output = True
    summary = True
    
It will save to an output.txt file.
